# emenu
---
emenu is a kinda-fork (I didn't just modify the main source, but I used the `drw` library it provides) of dmenu designed for two 
reasons: learning purposes, and making something I can and will actually use. This software is like the US constitution: it was 
written by me for me - if it doesn't work for you, too bad. That was not the point.

## Installation

Run `make` to build the `emenu` binary, then add the emenu directory to `$PATH`.

## License

Same as dmenu - see LICENSE.
